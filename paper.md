# Summary
With the emergence of a new pandemic worldwide, a novel strategy to approach
it has also emerged.
Several initiatives under the umbrella of *open science* are contributing to
tackle this unprecedented situation.
In particular, the *R Language and Environment for Statistical Computing*
[@citeR; @ihaka:1996] offers an excellent tool and ecosystem for
approaches focusing on open science and reproducible research.
Hence it is not surprising that with the onset of the pandemic, a large number
of R packages and resources were made available for researches working in the
pandemic.

In this paper, we present the `covid19.analytics` R package which allows users
to access and analyze worldwide data from publicly available resources.

The package also provides basic analysis and visualization tools and functions
to investigate these datasets and other ones structured in a similar fashion.


# Statement of need
The `covid19.analytics` package is an open source tool, which its main implementation and API
is the R package [@covid19analytics] which its stable version is part of CRAN [@cran].
In addition to this, the package has a few more adds-on:

- a central GitHUB repository, <https://github.com/mponce0/covid19.analytics>
  where the latest development version and source code of the package are
available.
Users can also submit tickets for bugs, suggestions or comments using the "issues" tab.

- a rendered version with live examples and documentation also hosted at GitHUB
  pages, <https://mponce0.github.io/covid19.analytics/>

- a dashboard for interactive usage of the package with extended capabilities
  for users without any coding expertise,
<https://covid19analytics.scinet.utoronto.ca>

- a **backup** data repository hosted at GitHUB,
  <https://github.com/mponce0/covid19analytics.datasets> -- where replicas of
the live datasets are stored for redundancy and robust accessibility sake (see \autoref{fig:dataSrcs}).


The `covid19.analytics` R package allows users to obtain
live^[The data usually is accessible from the repositories with a 24
hours delay.] worldwide data of reported cases from the novel *Corona Virus
Disease* (CoViD19), as well as related datasets, such as, genomics data,
vaccinations records and historical pandemics records.
It does this by accessing and retrieving the data publicly available and
published by several sources:

- the "COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and
  Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University" [@JHUCSSErepo] for the
worldwide and US data
- Health Canada [@HealthCanada], for Canada specific data
- the city of Toronto for Toronto data [@TorontoData]
- Open Data Toronto for Toronto data [@OpenDataToronto]
- Our World In Data for vaccination data [@OWIDvaccination]
- NCBI servers for genomics datasets [@NCBIdatabases]
- Visual Capitalist infographics for historical pandemic records [@VCpandemics]

The package also incorporates a dashboard to facilitate the access to its
functionalities to less experienced users (see \autoref{fig:dashboard}).

As today, there are a few dozen other packages also in the CRAN repository that
allow users to gain access to different datasets of the CoViD19 pandemic.
In some cases, some packages just provide access to data from specific
geographical locations or the approach to the data structure in which the
data is presented is different from the one presented here.
Nevertheless, having a variety of packages from which users can try and
probably combine, is an important and crucial element in data analysis.
Moreover it has been reported different cases of data misuse/misinterpretation
due to different issues, such as, erroneous metadata or data formats
[@Ledford_2020] and in some cases ending in articles' retractions [@Schriml:2020aa].
Therefore providing additional functionalities to check the integrity and
consistency of the data, as our `covid19.analytics` package does is paramount.
This is specially true in a situation where the unfolding of events and data
availability is flowing so fast that sometimes is even hard to keep track of
all the changes.

Moreover, the `covid19.analytics` package offers a modular and versatile approach to
the data, by allowing users to input their own data for which most of the
package functions can be applied when the data is structured using a
*time series* format as described in the package documentation.

The `covid19.analytics` package  is also capable of retrieving genomics data, and it does that
by incorporating a novel, more reliable and robust way of accessing and
designing different pathways to the data sources.

Another unique feature of this package is the ability of incorporating models
to estimate the disease spread by using the actual data.
Although a simple model, it has shown some interesting results in agreement
for certain cases.
Of course there are more sophisticated approaches to shred light in analyzing
this pandemic; in particular novel *community* approaches have been catalyzed
by this too [@Luengo-Oroz:2020aa].
However all of these approaches face new challenges as well [@Hu:2020aa],
and on that regards counting with a variety, in particular of open source tools
and direct access to the data might help on this front.

Further details, documentation, examples and tutorials of the `covid19.analytics` package can be found on the [package repository](https://github.com/mponce0/covid19.analytics) and [@ponce2020covid19analytics].
